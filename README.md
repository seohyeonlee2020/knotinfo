Automating the process to identify ribbon links in LinkInfo

Obstructions used to filter for potential ribbon links:
 - Alexander polynomial 0
 - Linking matrix consists of zeroes only.
 - Jones polynomial is factorable by the jones polynomial of the unlink with the same number of components. (= jones determinant is defined)
 - Jones determinant is equivalent to 1 mod 8
 - Jones determinant is equivalent to the product of the determinants of all components mod 32
 - Fulfills the Fox-Milnor condition
